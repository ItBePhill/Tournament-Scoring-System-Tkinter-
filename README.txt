Run Signup.py first as it will open Events.py on it's own.
If using visual studio it has to be run in the integrated terminal, should be used anyway due to launch json but just making sure. 
(unless using windows 11 as it works on the Terminal app.)
command prompt and IDLE don't like the colours in school for some reason.
it's really broken on IDLE for some unknown reason it doesn't like getpass.
if there is a <-30m or similar before prints it's because of the colours.
File editing/ making is really broken in replit idk why I think they just handle files differently to windows
you can also use it without colours.
(I'm not sure what the import (package) could not be resolved is as colorama has to be installed and Events is my own script).
