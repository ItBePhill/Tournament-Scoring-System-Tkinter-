Launch dist\Launcher.exe to start the program.
If there's any issues with it just launch the Launcher.py file.

I tried stopping the message box windows from focusing the main window but couldnt find a way.

I haven't named the events because I cant think of anything lol

The team/individual viewer in the launcher is done but looks a little bare might change later.

I never really used the logs so that is why it is in signup and a bit in events but not launcher.
